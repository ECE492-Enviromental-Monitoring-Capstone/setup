# Getting Started

This project makes use of a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.  
TODO: Add better description.

# Hardware Setup

Please add a detailed setup process including some wiring diagrams
And some images.  
Place images and figures in ./images/ please.


# Software Setup

Before you start using the Raspberry Pi, you need to create a microSD
card with the appropriate firmware on it to get started.


This can be done either from scratch, or you can use a pre-built ISO file.
The later is much easier and done much more quickly.


## Pre-built ISO file

TODO: Actually make a pre-built ISO that can be used instead of the from
scratch method.

## From Scratch

To create a microSD card from scratch, you are best served using a Linux
operating system like Ubuntu. Generally low level storage control in Windows
is terrible. And building an OS SD card is entirely that.


First you need to download an .iso file for the OS from the Raspberry Pi website.

The basis OS used in this project is Raspberry Pi OS Lite.
